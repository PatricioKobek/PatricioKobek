# About Me
My name is Patricio, and I am a self-taught data analyst from Canada with previous education and work experience in commerce, literary analysis, and teaching at Canada's top university. I am currently developing my toolkit in SQL, Python, and Tableau.

## Projects & Guides
Each data analytic project includes my SQL code and notes documenting the process from beginning to end. This is useful if you would like to replicate any project for your own portfolio, especially if you become stuck with a data set. If you find an obstacle, refer to the code documentation for common problems I discovered during data set cleaning and validation. I'm always available to answer questions about my previous sample projects.

Next steps are to improve markdown formatting, add tables (for projects), add color to SQL code blocks for improved readability, maybe add a few emojis.
